Discharge Summary:

Admission Date: 2025-06-01
Discharge Date: 2025-06-07

Patient Name: John Doe
Age/Sex: 39-year-old Male
Medical Record Number: 20250501001

Admission Diagnosis: Unspecified respiratory tract infection
Discharge Diagnosis: Resolved respiratory tract infection

Hospital Course: The patient was hospitalized due to persistent fever and dry cough for 2 weeks, leading to reduced general health condition. On admission, the patient required 4 L/min of oxygen due to rapid shallow breathing at rest and severe breathlessness during minor physical activity. The initial physical therapy focused on educating the patient on dyspnea-relieving positions, mobilization techniques, and deep-breathing exercises. However, with time, the patient's anxiety-induced dyspnea became an issue, leading to the modification of therapy to relieve his dyspnea.

The patient positively responded to the therapy, evidenced by a reduction in respiratory rate from 30 to 22 breaths/min and an increase in oxygen saturation from 92% to 96% on 4 L/min oxygen. Over the next few days, his dyspnea and anxiety started to alleviate gradually, and the patient regained his self-confidence. The therapy was eventually shifted to walking and strength training, and the patient was able to walk for 350m without a walking aid or supplemental oxygen before discharge.

Hospital Outcome: The patient was discharged home in an improved condition, with resolved respiratory tract infection, showing no need for further hospitalization. The patient was advised to follow-up with his regular healthcare professional for further monitoring and management of his health status.

Discharge Medications: None

Impression: Resolved respiratory tract infection with successful physical therapy for dyspnea relief and anxiety reduction. The patient responded well to therapy and regained his self-confidence, able to walk independently before discharge.
